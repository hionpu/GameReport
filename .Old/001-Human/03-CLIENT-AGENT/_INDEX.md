## 🔗 Cross-Agent Dependencies
### DESIGN Agent
- `01-DESIGN-AGENT/Feature-Specifications/` → UI/UX requirements reference
- `01-DESIGN-AGENT/User-Stories/` → User experience design reference

### SERVER Agent
- `02-SERVER-AGENT/API-Specifications/` → Server communication logic implementation

### LEAD Agent
- Architecture decisions and performance optimization direction consultation

## ⚠️ Important Notes
- Must support multiple resolutions/aspect ratios (1920x1080 ~ 1366x768)
- Include network error handling logic for server communication
- Consider mobile expansion possibilities for memory optimization
- Prioritize reusability and extensibility in component design

## 📝 Work Guidelines
1. **New UI Implementation**: Check design requirements, then create design doc in UI-UX-Design/
2. **Scene Addition**: Document scene structure and transition logic in Scene-Management/
3. **Server Communication**: Verify API specs before implementing communication modules
4. **Performance Issues**: Record profiling results and solutions in Platform-Optimization/

## 🎯 Performance Targets
- **Frame Rate**: 60fps target
- **Memory Usage**: <2GB RAM usage
- **Loading Time**: <3s for scene transitions
- **UI Responsiveness**: <16ms input response time

### Dependencies:
- **Requires**: Design specifications and server APIs for complete implementation
- **Blocks**: Final game experience depends on client implementation quality

### Cross-Agent Impact:
- **DESIGN**: Provides feedback on UI/UX feasibility and user experience implications
- **SERVER**: Consumes server APIs and reports integration issues or performance concerns
- **CLIENT**: Central hub for all Unity implementation and user-facing feature tracking
- **LEAD**: Monitors client development progress and user experience quality
