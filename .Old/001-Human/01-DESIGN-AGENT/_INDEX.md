## ⚠️ Important Notes
- Verify implementation feasibility with SERVER/CLIENT agents when creating feature specs
- Game balance decisions require post-implementation testing and validation
- All design decisions must be documented in this folder for traceability

## 📝 Work Guidelines
1. **New Feature Planning**: Create specification in Feature-Specifications/ folder
2. **Core Design Changes**: Update main GDD in Game-Design-Documents/ folder  
3. **Balance Adjustments**: Record changes and rationale in Game-Balance/ folder
4. **Important Decisions**: Document decision process and reasoning in Design-Decisions/ folder

## 🎯 Next Steps
1. Create Main Game Design Document
2. Define core gameplay loop
3. Establish technical constraints with other agents
4. Prioritize feature development roadmap
