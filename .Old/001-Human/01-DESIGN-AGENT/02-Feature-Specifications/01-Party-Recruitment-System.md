## âœ… Design Decisions

### Total Class Count at Launch

**Decision**: **Limited Respec Available**
- **Respec Tokens**: Earned through high-level raid completions (rare resource)
- **Gold Alternative**: High gold cost (scales with member level) for immediate respec
- **Free Respec**: One free respec per member at level milestones (10, 20, 30)
- **Strategic Value**: Makes initial talent choice meaningful while allowing flexibility

  - Low loyalty = chance to leave party or underperform
- **Loyalty Actions**: 
  - Positive: Winning raids, getting equipment, being used in party
  - Negative: Losing raids, being benched long-term, dismissing friends
