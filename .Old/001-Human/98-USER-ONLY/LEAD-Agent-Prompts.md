## Important Notes
- All decisions prioritize solo development environment first
- For inter-agent decision conflicts, prioritize project completion
- Present practical solutions over perfect design
- Technical debt acceptable short-term, manage long-term
- Always consider developer's learning curve and stress level
- Document all important decisions for future reference
