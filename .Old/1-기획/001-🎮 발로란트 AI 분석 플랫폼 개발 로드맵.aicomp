Phase 1 in progress Gaming-appropriate typography choices,Icon systems for game elements,Visual hierarchy and readability optimization|## App Naming Considerations|### Current Name Analysis:InsightGG,Pros:Clear connection to gaming (GG = Good Game),indicates analytical insights,Cons:When published online as 'insight.gg',the domain feels too vanilla,Issue:"insight" alone lacks distinctiveness and gaming context|### Naming Strategy Thoughts,The domain name 'insight.gg' loses the gaming context that makes InsightGG work. Need to consider:- More distinctive names that work both as app name and domain Names that maintain gaming connection even in domain format,Brandable options that aren't too generic|### Next Steps for Naming,Brainstorm alternatives that work well as both app name and domain,Consider gaming-specific terminology that's memorable,Test domain availability for preferred options,Evaluate SEO implications of different naming choices
