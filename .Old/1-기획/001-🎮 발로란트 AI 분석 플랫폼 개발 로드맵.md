## App Naming Considerations

### Current Name Analysis: InsightGG
- **Pros**: Clear connection to gaming (GG = Good Game), indicates analytical insights
- **Cons**: When published online as 'insight.gg', the domain feels too vanilla
- **Issue**: "insight" alone lacks distinctiveness and gaming context

### Naming Strategy Thoughts
The domain name 'insight.gg' loses the gaming context that makes InsightGG work. Need to consider:
- More distinctive names that work both as app name and domain
- Names that maintain gaming connection even in domain format
- Brandable options that aren't too generic

### Next Steps for Naming
- Brainstorm alternatives that work well as both app name and domain
- Consider gaming-specific terminology that's memorable
- Test domain availability for preferred options
- Evaluate SEO implications of different naming choices
