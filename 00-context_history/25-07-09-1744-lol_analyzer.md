   * Project Structure (Python Server):

      The structure for the analysis component has been established, with a base class and a concrete implementation
  for League of Legends.


   * Current Plan:
       * We are in Phase 1: MVP - Statistical Aggregation.
       * The objective is to build the foundational data pipeline.
       * The current strategy is to implement the analysis logic using Python scripts to ensure a rapid MVP launch. The
         core processing will be upgraded to a C++ engine in Phase 2.


   * Recent Changes:
       * The most recent commit updated the gemini.md rule definitions and modified the Python analysis server.
       * The file dev/python/analyzers/lol_analyzer.py was created and then modified.
       * Its current state shows that the LolAnalyzer class skeleton is complete, and the fetch_data method has been
         implemented with mock data, as per our last step.


   * Next Suggested Step:
       * Based on our progress, the next task is to implement the `process_data` method within the LolAnalyzer class.
         This method will take the mock data from fetch_data as input and transform it into a structured format suitable
         for analysis.
