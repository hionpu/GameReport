### Project Status Report

*   **Project Structure:** The Python project has a `main.py` acting as a FastAPI server, an `analyzers` directory with `lol_analyzer.py`, and a `database` directory with `db_handler.py`. The Go project structure is also in place but not the current focus.

*   **Current Plan:** We are in Phase 1, building the MVP data pipeline using Python. The goal is to create a runnable script that fetches mock data, processes it, and saves it to the database.

*   **Active Development Context:**
    *   The `git status` command shows that `dev/python/main.py` and `dev/python/analyzers/lol_analyzer.py` are the most recently modified files.
    *   The user has just run the `main.py` script and encountered two issues:
        1.  A database schema error: `Could not find the 'assists' column`.
        2.  A structural issue in `main.py` where the analysis function is not being called correctly because the file is also trying to run a Uvicorn server.

*   **Next Suggested Step:** The immediate next step is to refactor the Python application by separating the web server logic from the pipeline execution logic. This involves moving the analysis-running code from `main.py` into a new, dedicated script called `run_pipeline.py`. This will resolve the execution conflict and allow us to properly test the data pipeline. The database schema error must be fixed manually by the user in their Supabase dashboard.
