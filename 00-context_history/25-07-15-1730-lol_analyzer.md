### Project Status Report - July 15, 2025

*   **Project Structure:** The Python project has a clean structure with `main.py` as a dedicated FastAPI server, `run_pipeline.py` as the entry point for data processing, and the core logic residing in `analyzers/lol_analyzer.py` and `database/db_handler.py`.

*   **Current Project Plan:** We are in Phase 1, focusing on the Python data pipeline. We have successfully created and debugged a pipeline that uses mock data.

*   **Recent Changes & Learning Milestones:**
    *   **Refactoring:** We successfully refactored the application, separating the web server concerns from the data pipeline concerns. This fixed the initial execution conflict and made the system more robust and testable.
    *   **Debugging:** We systematically diagnosed a misleading database error. After confirming the Python code was correct, we hypothesized a schema cache issue. The user ultimately discovered the root cause was a misunderstanding of the database table structure (rows vs. columns), leading to a successful data insertion.
    *   **Current State:** The pipeline (`run_pipeline.py`) is fully functional and successfully inserts 10 mock match records into the Supabase `matches` table.

*   **Next Suggested Learning Challenge:** The next step is to replace the mock data with live data from the Riot Games API. We have confirmed the `requests` library is available. The immediate challenge is to decide on the best design for fetching the data: a single monolithic function or two separated functions (`_fetch_match_ids` and `_fetch_match_details`). This will be the starting point for our next session.
