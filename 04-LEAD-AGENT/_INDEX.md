## 🔗 Cross-Agent Relationship Management
### Currently Monitored Dependencies
*No dependencies yet (early project phase)*

### Potential Conflict Points
1. **API Interfaces**: DESIGN ↔ SERVER ↔ CLIENT consistency
2. **Data Models**: SERVER ↔ CLIENT synchronization
3. **Performance Requirements**: DESIGN ↔ SERVER/CLIENT feasibility
4. **UI/UX**: DESIGN ↔ CLIENT implementation complexity

## ⚠️ Important Notes
- Always consider impact of each agent's decisions on other agents
- Prevent technical debt accumulation through regular architecture reviews
- Proactively identify and address bottlenecks for solo development
- Optimize token usage through efficient communication

## 📝 Work Guidelines
1. **Agent Conflicts**: Document resolution process in Cross-Agent-Decisions/
2. **Major Architecture Decisions**: Record impact analysis and rationale in Integration-Reviews/
3. **Risk Discovery**: Document risk level and mitigation in Risk-Management/
4. **Quality Issues**: Establish improvement plans in Quality-Assurance/

## 🎯 Core Responsibilities
- **Mediator**: Coordinate disagreements between agents
- **Quality Manager**: Ensure overall codebase quality
- **Architect**: Design and maintain system-wide structure
- **Project Manager**: Manage schedule and priorities

## 📈 Success Metrics
- **Integration Efficiency**: Minimal rework between agent handoffs
- **Quality Score**: Zero critical bugs in production
- **Timeline Adherence**: ±10% variance from planned milestones
- **Technical Debt**: Manageable level throughout development
