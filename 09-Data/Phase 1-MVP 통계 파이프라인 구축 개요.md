# Phase 1: Foundational Data Pipeline - Detailed Plan (v3.0)

## 1. Overview ðŸŽ¯

**Goal:** To build an automated pipeline that collects both match results and key timeline events from the Riot API. The data will be processed and stored in a structured database, creating a robust and scalable foundation for all future analysis features in Phases 2 and 3.

---

## 2. Core Data Collection Strategy

- **1 Match, 10-Player Data:** Maximize API efficiency by processing and storing the performance data for all 10 participants from a single match fetch. One API call yields 10 rows of performance data.
- **Proactive Timeline Data Collection:** Fetch both the `MatchDTO` (end-game results) and the `MatchTimelineDTO` (event logs) from the very beginning. This prevents the need to re-fetch data for old matches when developing future features.
- **Organic User Pool Expansion (Snowball Effect):** Use the participants from collected matches to discover new users, organically growing the list of players to track.

---

## 3. Riot API Endpoints to Use

- **A. Acquiring Seed Users:** `LEAGUE-V4`
  - `lol/league/v4/challengerleagues/by-queue/{queue}`
  - `lol/league/v4/grandmasterleagues/by-queue/{queue}`
  - `lol/league/v4/masterleagues/by-queue/{queue}`
- **B. Converting User Identifiers:** `SUMMONER-V4`
  - `lol/summoner/v4/summoners/{encryptedSummonerId}` -> to get `puuid`.
- **C. Collecting Match ID Lists:** `MATCH-V5`
  - `lol/match/v5/matches/by-puuid/{puuid}/ids`
- **D. Collecting Detailed Match Data:** `MATCH-V5`
  - `lol/match/v5/matches/{matchId}` -> `MatchDTO`
  - `lol/match/v5/matches/{matchId}/timeline` -> `MatchTimelineDTO`

**â€» Important:** All API calls must respect Riot's rate limits. Implementing appropriate delays (e.g., `time.sleep()`) between requests is mandatory.

## 4. Database Table Design (PostgreSQL)

This design includes storing key events from the timeline, adopting a balanced approach between data completeness and initial complexity.

### `matches` (Individual Match Performance)
Stores the final end-game stats for each player in a match. (10 rows generated per match).

## 5. Python Script Structure & Key Functions

**Note:** The following Python-based structure is for the initial **Phase 1 MVP** to ensure a rapid launch. The core data processing and aggregation logic will be migrated to a high-performance **C++ engine in Phase 2** to ensure scalability.

A modular structure is recommended for maintainability.


```

lol_pipeline/ 
â”œâ”€â”€ main.py       # Main script to orchestrate the entire pipeline 
â”œâ”€â”€ api/          # FastAPI server code 
â”‚ â””â”€â”€ server.py 
â”œâ”€â”€ collector/    # Module for fetching data from Riot API 
â”‚ â””â”€â”€ riot_api.py
â”œâ”€â”€ processor/    # Module for processing and transforming data 
â”‚ â””â”€â”€ data_processor.py 
â”œâ”€â”€ database/     # Module for all database interactions
â”‚ â””â”€â”€ db_handler.py 
â””â”€â”€ config.py     # API keys, database credentials, etc.

```

### Key Function Specifications

#### `collector/riot_api.py`
- `fetch_match_data(match_id)`: Fetches the `MatchDTO`.
- `fetch_timeline_data(match_id)`: Fetches the `MatchTimelineDTO`.
- (Other functions for getting user lists and match histories).

#### `processor/data_processor.py`
- **`process_match_and_timeline(match_json, timeline_json)`**:
    1.  Parses `match_json` to generate a **list of 10 dictionaries** for the `matches` table.
    2.  Parses `timeline_json` to generate a **list of dictionaries** for the `match_events` table (only for the core event types).
    3.  Returns a dictionary containing these lists, e.g., `{"matches": [...], "events": [...]}`.

#### `database/db_handler.py`
- **`bulk_insert_matches(match_data_list)`**: Inserts a list of match performance records into the `matches` table.
- **`bulk_insert_events(event_data_list)`**: Inserts a list of event records into the `match_events` table.
- (Other functions for managing `tracked_users` and querying data).

#### `main.py`
- **`run_daily_pipeline()`**:
    1.  Get a batch of users to process from the database.
    2.  For each user, get their recent match history.
    3.  For each new `match_id`, fetch both the `MatchDTO` and `MatchTimelineDTO`.
    4.  Call `processor.process_match_and_timeline()` to process all data.
    5.  Call the `db_handler` functions to bulk-insert the processed data into the `matches` and `match_events` tables.
    6.  Add any new players discovered to the `tracked_users` list.
    7.  After all matches are processed, run the aggregation script to update the `aggregated_stats` table.
