# 001 - Daily Gaming Report Card - Project Overview

## üéØ Project Vision

**Goal**: Solo developer building first app for digital nomad/FIRE lifestyle **Mission**: Create a recurring-value gaming analytics web application with minimal complexity

## üìã App Requirements

### Core Requirements

- **Single Web Page Application**: User input (summoner name) ‚Üí show results
    
- **Daily Value**: Must provide fresh insights every day
    
- **Recurring Usage**: Not a one-time tool, users return daily
    
- **Low Complexity**: Manageable for solo developer
    

### **Core Features**

- **Overall Skill Report (Long-Term Growth Analysis):** Tracks and visualizes changes in a user's playstyle and key performance indicators (KPIs) by comparing their current performance period to previous ones.
    
- **Single-Match Deep Dive:** Provides multi-faceted, actionable feedback on a single match by comparing it against both the user's personal baseline and a top-tier player benchmark.
    

### Target User Experience

1. User enters summoner name (e.g., "TenZ#NA1")
    
2. System fetches recent matches via Riot API
    
3. AI generates personalized daily report card
    
4. User returns daily for fresh analysis and progress tracking
    

## üîç Market Research Findings

### API Data Assessment

**League of Legends/Valorant APIs Provide**:

- Match history data (recent games, performance stats)
    
- Player rankings and progression
    
- Champion/agent performance metrics
    
- Detailed match statistics (K/D/A, CS, damage, etc.)
    
- **Timeline data (frame-by-frame snapshots and events)**
    

**API Limitations**:

- No granular real-time gameplay events
    
- Rate limiting constraints (120 requests/2min)
    
- Historical data depth varies by region
    

### Competitive Landscape

**Major Players**: OP.GG, Mobalytics, Blitz.gg, U.GG **Market Status**: Competitive but not monopolized **Opportunity**: AI integration is emerging trend, not saturated **Differentiation Strategy**: **Focus on personalized, context-aware daily insights and progress tracking rather than raw data presentation.**

## üéÆ Recommended Prototype: Daily Gaming Report Card

### Core Concept

Transform gaming data into actionable daily insights, similar to a "fitness tracker for gaming performance"

### Technical Approach

#### **Architecture**

- **Hybrid Dual Server Model:** Adopt a microservice architecture to separate stable API handling from complex data analysis, leveraging the strengths of multiple languages.
    
    - **Elixir + Phoenix (Main Server):** Acts as the user-facing orchestrator. It handles user authentication, API requests, and serving web pages.
        
    - **Python + C++ (Analysis/ML Server):** A dual-language analysis engine. Python handles high-level orchestration, API communication, and AI integration. A high-performance C++ component (introduced in Phase 2) handles large-scale, offline batch processing of match data for maximum efficiency and scalability.
        
- **Internal Communication:** The Go and Python servers communicate over an internal network via a REST API or gRPC.
    

#### **Data Flow**

```
User ‚Üí Elixir API ‚Üí Python API ‚Üí (Riot API + Internal DB + AI API) ‚Üí Python API ‚Üí Elixir API ‚Üí User
```

#### **Data Analysis Strategy**

- **Phase 1: Statistical Aggregation:** The system will pre-calculate key benchmark metrics from top-tier player data (e.g., average KDA by champion, item win rates) and store them in a database. This forms the foundation of the MVP's analysis. **This will be initially implemented using a simple Python script to ensure a rapid MVP launch.**
    
- **Phase 2: Correlation & Pattern Analysis:** The system will automatically discover meaningful relationships within the data (e.g., "this rune choice correlates with higher DPM") and save them as "discovered patterns." **This phase will be enabled by developing and integrating a high-performance C++ batch processing engine, which will replace the initial Python script to handle large-scale data aggregation and pattern discovery.**
    
- **Phase 3: Machine Learning Integration:** As a long-term goal, the system will incorporate ML models (e.g., win prediction, playstyle clustering) to unearth exclusive insights. **The ML models will be trained on the rich, aggregated data produced by the C++ engine.**
    

### Monetization Strategy

**Freemium Model**:

- **Free Tier**: Basic daily reports, limited to 1 analysis per day
    
- **Premium ($5/month)**: Unlimited analyses, **long-term growth reports, single-match deep dives,** progress history
    

## üöÄ MVP Features

### Core Features

1. **Summoner Search**: Simple input field for summoner name + tag
    
2. **Recent Games Analysis**: Last 5 games performance review
    
3. **AI-Powered Insights (2-Track):**
    
    - **"Better Than Yesterday"**: A concise report comparing recent performance against the previous day's games to highlight trends.
        
    - **"1 Key Success & 1 Area to Improve"**: Pinpoints the single best aspect of a specific match and the one biggest weakness when compared to top-tier players.
        
4. **Simple Visualization**: Basic progress charts
    
5. **Daily Check-in**: Encouragement to return daily
    

### User Interface Elements

- Clean, card-based design
    
- Mobile-responsive layout
    
- Minimal loading states
    
- Share functionality for social media

- **Implement the data pipeline (ETL) for Riot API data collection and DB storage.**
    
- **Implement basic statistical aggregation features (Analysis Strategy Phase 1).**
    
- Launch the core features (Overall Report, Match Analysis) in a basic version.
    

### **Phase 2: Enhancement - Introduce Pattern Analysis (4 weeks)**

- **Add correlation analysis logic (Analysis Strategy Phase 2).**
    
- Improve UI/UX based on user feedback.
    
- Implement payment system and launch the premium model.
    
- Begin initial marketing and user acquisition efforts.
    

### **Phase 3: Specialization - Add ML Features (8+ weeks)**

- Optimize the service based on user behavior data.
    
- Expand with new features, such as community functions.
    

## üéØ Next Steps

1. **Technical Planning**: **Define API contracts (request/response specs) between the Elixir and Python services.**
    
2. **UI/UX Design**: Create wireframes for the daily report card **and the match deep-dive view.**
    
3. **Database Design**: **Design schemas for raw data, aggregated stats, and discovered patterns.**
    
4. **AI Prompt Engineering**: Develop templates for **each analysis type (growth vs. deep-dive).**
    
5. **Development Setup**: Initialize **separate Elixir and Python project structures.**
    
6. **MVP Development**: Start with the basic prototype.
    

This focused approach prioritizes execution speed and user value over technical complexity, making it ideal for a solo developer building their first commercial application.
